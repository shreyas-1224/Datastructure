to find the substring in a string , use find function . 

int found = str1.find(str2);


if(found != string ::npos)
	// found will give the first occurance of that substring
else
	no substring.
	
str::npos is basically end of the string.

_______________________________________________________

use string.substr(starting index , number of next char to be included).

for palindome problem , 2-d dp is very useful.
